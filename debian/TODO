- libdiscover package name clashes with the discover (hardware identification
  system) namespace.
  From the install file the libs lack soversion, and could at least be further splitted in
  discover-common discover-notifiers muon-apt qml-module-org-kde-discover
  muon-repo
  Do these libs even need to be in their own packages?
